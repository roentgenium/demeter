"The check buttons next to each path in the path list are central to many "
"features in :demeter:`artemis` related to plotting and other tasks. Along"
" with all of the tools in the Mark menu, you can mark a group of paths by"
" :mark:`leftclick,..` clicking elsewhere on the path list while holding "
"down the :button:`Shift` key. Doing so marks all paths between the "
"selected one and the one :button:`Shift`-:mark:`leftclick,..` clicked "
"upon."

":button:`Control`-:mark:`leftclick,..` clicking on the path list is also "
"a special function used for two purposes. Doing a "
":button:`Control`-:mark:`leftclick,..` click starts a drag-and-drop with "
"the path you click on. Dropping the path on another data window, copies "
"If you drop the path on the same path list, that path to that Data set.  "
"Dropping the path on the same path list is equivalent to cloning the "
"dragged path, with the clone being appended to the end of the path list."

"Mistakenly :button:`Control`-:mark:`leftclick,..` clicking rather than "
":button:`Shift`-:mark:`leftclick,..` clicking will likely result in a "
"path being cloned. This can be surprising and confusing, so please take "
"care and be mindful!"

":demeter:`artemis` has no special plot types involving individual paths "

":demeter:`artemis` offers a concept called a :quoted:`virtual path`, or a"
" :quoted:`VPath`.  A VPath is an ensemble of normal paths which are "
"summed.  The sum is then plotted in k-, R-, or q-space.  A VPath is made "
"by marking a set of paths then selecting :menuselection:`Actions --> Make"
" VPath from marked`.  VPaths are discussed in more detail `the chapter on"
" the Plot window <../plot/vpaths.html>`__."

"Data on a gold foil plotted as Re[ |chi| (R)] with the fourth shell "

"these three paths."

"The VPath composed of those three paths is plotted along with the data. "
"This is a much cleaner plot and gives you a sense of the net impact of "

"When the VPath is created, it is placed in the VPath tab in the Plot "
"window and in the Plotting list. The VPath list contains tools for "
"renaming and discarding VPaths, displaying its constituants in the Main "
"window status bar, and a VPath onto the Plotting list. (Remember that, "
"unless the :guilabel:`Freeze` button is clicked, the Plotting list is "
"cleared and repopulated after each fit.)"

msgid ""
"When the Data page button labeled :guilabel:`Plot with phase correction`,"
" plots using that data set and/or any of its paths will be plotted with "
"phase correction. This means that the contributions of the central and "
"scattering atom phase shifts will be removed before the Fourier "
"transform. This has the effect of shifting the peaks in |chi| (R) by "
"about -0.5 |AA|, such that the first shell peaks at an R value close to "
"the physical interatomic distance between the absorber and first shell "
"scatterer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../path/plot.rst:153
msgid ""
"The phase information is taken from one of the paths. Each path has a "
"button labeled :guilabel:`Use this path for phase corrected plotting`. "
"These buttons are exclusive |nd| only one path per data set can have its "
"button ticked on. The phase information from that path is used for the "
"phase corrected plots."
msgstr ""

#: ../../path/plot.rst:159
msgid ""
"If you turn on phase corrected plotting without having selected a path to"
" use, :demeter:`artemis` will issue a warning in the status bar and turn "
"phase corrected plotting back off. You **must** select a path to use as "
"the source of the phase information."
msgstr ""

#: ../../path/plot.rst:164
msgid ""
"Note that, when making a phase corrected plot, the window function in R "
"is not corrected in any way.  The window is plotted using the R-range of "
"the fit.  If you change the R-range so that the window lines up with the "
"phase corrected plot, you **must** remember to change it back before "
"making a new fit or making a plot in q-space."
msgstr ""

#: ../../path/plot.rst:170
msgid ""
"Also note that the phase correction propagates through to |chi| (q). "
"While the window function will display sensibly with the central atom "
"phase corrected |chi| (q), a :quoted:`kq` plot will be somewhat less "
"insightful because phase correction is not performed on the original "
"|chi| (k) data."
