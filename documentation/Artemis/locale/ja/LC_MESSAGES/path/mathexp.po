"Once some paths have been dragged from the :demeter:`feff` window onto "
"the Data window containing the gold foil data, it is time to begin "
"defining math expressions for the path parameters. In the following "
"figure, the path corresponding to the first coordination shell has been "
"selected from the path list. A path is selected by :mark:`leftclick,..` "
"left clicking on its label in the path list. Doing so, displays that path"
" on the right side of the Data window."

"At the top of the Path page are two checkboxes. One is used to include "

"which paths are used in a fit without having to remove them from the path"
" list. The other check box is used to indicate if the current path should"
" be transfered to the plotting list in the Plot window at the end of a "
"fit."

"provided for |Delta| R.  The |sigma|\\ :sup:`2` path parameter is "
