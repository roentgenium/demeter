"The second window that appears when :demeter:`artemis` starts is the Plot"
" window. An overview of the functionality of this window will be "
"presented here, but the full picture of how plots are made in "
":demeter:`artemis` will have to wait until the Data and Path windows are "
"explained."

"At the top of the Plot window is a row of three buttons used to make "
"plots in k, R, or q space. These plots will be made using the contents of"
" the :guilabel:`Plotting list` near the bottom of the Plot window. The "
"plotting list gets populated with data, paths, and other plottable items."
" The details of how the plotting list gets populated will be discussed "
"later in the document."

"Beneath that is a set of radio buttons for setting the k-weighting to be "
"used in many of the kinds of plots that :demeter:`artemis` makes, "
"including those made when pressing the buttons above. Note that these "
"k-weight values are *only* used for making plots. The k-weight values "
"used to evaluate fits are set in the Data window. The :guilabel:`kw` "
"option uses the arbitrary (possibly non-integer) k-weighting value "
"specified in the Data window."

"Beneath the k-weight buttons is a set of tabs used to control different "
"aspects of plots. The :guilabel:`limits` tab provides controls for the "

"Because we use a complex Fourier transform, |chi| (R) and |chi| (q) are "
"complex functions. The two sets of radio buttons at the top of the limits"
" tab are used to specify how |chi| (R) and |chi| (q) are displayed. "
"Because a typical plot in :demeter:`artemis` involves many traces, "
":demeter:`artemis` does not allow over-plotting of the various parts of "
"the complex functions in the manner of :demeter:`athena`."

"The last item on the Plot window is a button labeled :button:`Save next "
"plot to a file,light`. When depressed, the next plot made will write a "
"column data file with columns representing the traces as they would have "
"been plotted. The plot will not be shown on the screen. The purpose of "
"this file is to reproduce a plot from :demeter:`artemis` as closely as "
"possible using some other plotting program."
