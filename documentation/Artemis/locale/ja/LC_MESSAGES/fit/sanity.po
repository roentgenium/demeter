":demeter:`artemis` is complex and it is quite easy to make mistakes. Many"
" common mistakes are obvious and discoverable by automated analysis of "
"the fitting model.  Before running a fit, :demeter:`artemis` applies each"
" of the following test to your fitting model.  If any of them are "
"triggered, the fit is halted and a (hopefully) useful error message is "
"posted in the Log window.  Think of this like :demeter:`artemis`' spell "
"checker!"

"As a side note, item 15 is particularly interesting. :demeter:`demeter` "
"does a simple lexical analysis on the ensemble of math expressions "
"defined on the GDS window, then uses `a formal graph theory tool "

"the parameters. Loops (like the first example) and cycles (like the "
"second) a trivially evident when the parameters are viewed as a formal "
"graph. That was a really fun part of :demeter:`demeter` to write."
