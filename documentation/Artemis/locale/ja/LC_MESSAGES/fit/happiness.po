":demeter:`artemis` evaluates a variety of statistical parameters relevant"
" to the evaluation of your fit.  These include the fitting metric |chi|\\"
" :sup:`2`, the fitting metric normalized by the degrees of freedom in the"
" fit |chi|\\ :sup:`2`\\ :sub:`v`, an R-factor, and the uncertainties of "
"and correlations between the variable parameters."

"In a formal sense, the most important of these parameters is |chi|\\ "
":sup:`2`\\ :sub:`v`, which is the statistical parameter allowing you to "
"distinguish between different fitting models applied to the same data. "
"Unfortunately, |chi|\\ :sup:`2`\\ :sub:`v` is difficult to interpret "
"directly.  In practice, the EXAFS analysis problem using :demeter:`feff` "
"is not a well-posed problem in the sense required by Gaussian statistics."
" This is true for a variety of reasons. In EXAFS, the signal is not "
"ideally packed |nd| that is, the signal is not composed of pure sine "
"waves. In general, you cannot guarantee that errors in your fitting "
"parameters are normally distributed. In general, we cannot actually "
"identify and enumerate all sources of measurement error, many of which "
"are complex and systematic, such as sample inhomogeneity, detector non-"
"linearity, and so on.  Finally, we do not know the true line shape of our"
" signal |nd| instead we use :demeter:`feff` to approximate the lineshape."
"  All of this is discussed further in my `Advanced Topics in EXAFS "
"Analysis talk <https://speakerdeck.com/bruceravel/advanced-topics-in-"
"exafs-analysis?slide=6>`_"

"For all those reasons, |chi|\\ :sup:`2`\\ :sub:`v` is rarely |nd| if ever"
" |nd| close to 1 as expected for a good fit. Although |chi|\\ :sup:`2`\\ "
":sub:`v` for different fitting models can be compared effectively, it is,"
" generally speaking, not a sufficient criterion for evaluating the "
"quality of an individual fit."

"Happily, this is not an insolvable problem. After decades of analyzing "
"EXAFS data, using :demeter:`feff`, and using :demeter:`ifeffit`, we know "
"a lot about what constitutes a good fit. For instance, a good fit has a "
"small R-factor, which is a measure of the percentage misfit between the "
"data and theory.  We know things about individual parameter types, e.g. "
"that an E\\ :sub:`0` is rarely more than 10 eV or less than -10 eV, that "
"S\\ :sup:`2`\\ :sub:`0` and |sigma|\\ :sup:`2` should never be negative. "
"We know that a robust fit does not have excessive correlation between "
"variable parameters."

":demeter:`artemis` offers a heuristic tool called :quoted:`happiness` "
"which is an attempt to enumerate the knowledge and experience we bring to"
" a fit. After a fit, this heuristic parameter is evaluated and reported "
"in the log file.  It has no meaning other that to give you a general "
"sense of how the fit came out."

"The word :quoted:`happiness` was chosen for this parameter because it is "
"a silly word in a statistics context. Happiness is an ad-hoc, semantic "
"metric.  It has no basis in formal statistics. It is a functionally "
"meaningless parameter and should **NEVER** be published.  **NEVER**!"
