":demeter:`artemis` is, admittedly, a complex and non-intuitive program. "
"There are good reasons for :demeter:`artemis` being the way it is, "
"although those reasons may not be clear if you are coming to the program "
"for the first time. While it is important that easy things be easy in "
":demeter:`artemis`, letting hard things be possible is central to the "
"intent of the program."

"The parameters of the EXAFS equation are not the parameters of the fit. "
"The parameters of the EXAFS equation are written *in terms of* the "
"parameters of the fit."

"As a consequence, we have the GDS window where the parameters of the fit "
"are *defined* and the various Path pages where those parameters are "

"It is useful to understand a little bit about how the fitting model is "
"structured internally.  The basic definition of a fit consists of three "
"things:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../fit/index.rst:71
msgid "a list of one or more GDS parameters,"
msgstr ""

#: ../../fit/index.rst:72
msgid "a list of one or more data sets, and"
msgstr ""

#: ../../fit/index.rst:75
msgid "To make a fit, all three of those lists must somehow be defined."

msgid ""
"The list of data sets is taken from the Data list in the Main window. All"
" data sets in the Data list which have the :guilabel:`Include in fit` "
"button checked on will be used in the fit."

"Each data set has a list of one or more paths associated with it.  In "
":demeter:`artemis` a path is associated with a data set by dragging and "
"dropping it onto a data set's path list.  The converse is also true.  All"
" paths used in a fit must be associated with a Data set."
msgstr ""

#: ../../fit/index.rst:86
msgid ""
"Paths typically come from a :demeter:`feff` calculation explicitly "
"initiated by the user.  That is, the user imports an :demeter:`atoms` "
"input file, a :demeter:`feff` input file, or a CIF file. :demeter:`feff` "
"is run and the interpretation list is displayed in the :demeter:`feff` "
"window.  Paths are dragged from that list and dropped on a Data set.  "
"Thus paths are not only associated with a Data set, they are also "
"associated with a specific :demeter:`feff` calculation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../fit/index.rst:95
msgid ""
"Each path must have its path parameters set in some manner, even if they "
"are merely set to 0 or some other constant.  Typically, path parameters "
"are set to math expressions which depend functionally upon one or more "
"parameters from the GDS page.  Every GDS parameter used in a path "
"parameter math expression must be defined on the GDS window. Similarly, "
"every :guess:`guess` or :def:`def` parameter from the GDS window must be "
"used in at least one math expression in your fitting model."

"When the fit begins, :demeter:`artemis` digs through all the windows, "
"finding all data sets, paths, and GDS parameters.  It runs a number of "
"sanity checks to avoid certain obvious situations which will result in an"
" unsuccessful fit.  It then makes sure that all of :demeter:`ifeffit`'s "
"(or :demeter:`larch`'s) data structures are up to date with respect to "
"your current settings in :demeter:`artemis`.  The fit is run.  "
"Statistics, including error bars and correlations, are calculated.  A log"
" file is written, a plot is made, and the various colored buttons are set"
" according to the fit happiness."

"There are some details of the fitting process that are `configurable "
"<../prefs.html>`__. For instance, the log file can be displayed in either"
" the Log window or in the History window after the fit finishes. You can "
"also choose not to have it display automatically. This is set by "
":configparam:`Artemis,show_after_fit`."

"The plot that is made upon completion of the fit is also configurable. "
"The default is to have an Rmr plot (:numref:`see Fig. %s <fig-plotRmr>`) "
"made containing the data and the fit. Any of the five plot types from the"
" Data window can be chosen as the after-fit plot. You may also choose to "
"have the contents of the plotting list plotted in k-, R-, or q-space.  "
"This adds value to the :guilabel:`Plot after fit` buttons on the Data "
"window and Path pages. You may also choose to have no plot displayed "
"automatically after the fit. This is set by "
":configparam:`Artemis,plot_after_fit`."

"The fit name and fit description text boxes from the Main window are also"
" useful for customizing your fit as well as the course of a fitting "
"project. The fit name is used in many places |nd| most notably in the "
"legends of plots. Thus you may find it useful to select descriptive names"
" for each of your fits. The fit description is written to every log file "
"and can be used to document features of your current fitting model and "
"how it relates to the development of your fitting project."
