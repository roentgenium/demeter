msgid ""
"An important feature of :demeter:`artemis` is the ability to make "
"interesting things that are constructed from tools that :demeter:`feff` "
"provides, but which are not paths in the traditional sense of being "
"strictly associated with one of the :file:`feffNNNN.dat` files that comes"
" from a normal execution of :demeter:`feff`."

#: ../../fit/pathlike.rst:53
msgid ""
"Some of these path-like objects are directly associated with a particular"
" :demeter:`feff` calculation.  For example, an SSPath created on the "
"Path-like tab on the :demeter:`feff` window is created directly from the "
"scattering potentials from that :demeter:`feff` calculation.  Similarly, "
"a histogram-based path-like object also uses a particular :demeter:`feff`"
" calculation."

#: ../../fit/pathlike.rst:60
msgid ""
"Other path-like objects either have a hidden relationship with a "
":demeter:`feff` calculation or none at all.  The path from a quick first "
"shell theory calculation does have a :demeter:`feff` calculation "
"associated with it, but it is done in a way that the user never interacts"
" with that calculation.  The quick first shell path does not have an "
"entry in the :demeter:`feff` list on the Main window.  An empirical "
"standard, as the name implies, is derived from data and therefor is not "
"associated with any :demeter:`feff` calculation."

#: ../../fit/pathlike.rst:69
msgid ""
"Although each of these path-like objects derives from a different place "
"than a typical path, :demeter:`artemis` presents them to the user "
"identically.  Each kind of path-like object is displayed using all the "
"same controls as a normal path and each is parametered and used in a fit "
"in the same way."
