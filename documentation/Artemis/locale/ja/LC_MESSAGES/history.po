":demeter:`artemis` keeps a complete history of your fitting project. "

"history is stored in the project file. This allows you to compare fits or"
" even to revert :demeter:`artemis` to an earlier fit."

"The History window shows two major controls.  On the left is a list all "
"fits performed as part of the fitting project.  Like many other lists in "
":demeter:`artemis`, this contains elements that can be selected and "
"marked. This list uses multiple selection, so "
":button:`Control`-:mark:`leftclick,.` clicking can be used to add to the "
"selection and :button:`Shift`-:mark:`leftclick,.` clicking can be used to"
" select groups of fits.  Much of the analysis discussed below uses the "
"selection. Some functionality uses the set of marked fits."

"small cost of a pause when examining log files."
