":demeter:`artemis` provides a number of tools for keeping track of things"
" going on behind the scenes. These tools are found either in the Monitor "
"menu on the Main window or the Debug menu on the Data window."

"In the normal course of operations, consulting the monitoring tools "
"should not be necessary. But if something is not working quite right, "
"they can be invaluable for diagnosing the problem."

"The command buffer window contains a record of every data processing and "

"is the plotting buffer, which contains every command sent to the plotting"
" backend (usually :program:`Gnuplot`)."

"These are very useful both for diagnosing problems and for learning the "
"details of how :demeter:`ifeffit`, :demeter:`larch` and "
":program:`Gnuplot` work."

"One of the submenus in the Monitor menu on the Main window allows you to "

"Several additional menu items are turned on when "

" current state of :demeter:`demeter` and its data structures. These tools"
" are invaluable for developing the software, but are probably of limited "
"value to the general user."
