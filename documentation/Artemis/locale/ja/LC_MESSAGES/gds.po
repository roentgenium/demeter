"A :set:`set` parameter is one that is evaluated at the beginning of the "

msgid ":lguess:`lguess`"
msgstr ""

#: ../../gds.rst:127
msgid ""
"An :lguess:`lguess` parameter is a tool used to simplify model creation "
"for a multiple data set fit.  It can be used in math expressions for two "
"or more data sets.  When the fit is started, an actual :guess:`guess` "
"parameter will be created for each data set in which the :lguess:`lguess`"
" is used.  As an example, suppose your multiple data set fit includes "
"data on a series of binary alloys. If ``x`` is a mixing parameter between"
" the two alloys and is different for each sample, you might then use math"
" expressions containing ``x`` and ``(1-x)`` for S\\ :sup:`2`\\ :sub:`0` "
"parameters of paths representing the two metallic species in each fit. "
"With ``x`` an :lguess:`lguess` parameter, independent mixing parameters "
"will be floated for each data set.  The point, then, of an "
":lguess:`lguess` is to facilitate the chore of editing path parameter "
"math expressions using :demeter:`artemis`' tools for pushing path "
"parameter values across paths.  This is discussed in more detail in `the "
"discussion of the characteristic value "
"<extended/cv.html#useinlguessparameters>`__."

"An :after:`after` parameter is very similar to a :def:`def` parameter in "

"not, however, used in any way in the fit. Instead, it is evaluated at the"
" end of the fit and reported to the log file. This is used to make "
"interesting calculations based on other parameters as part of the record "
"of the fit.  An :after:`after` parameter should never be used in the math"
