":demeter:`demeter` has a mountain of preferences available for the user "
"to tinker with.  This may, I suppose, be a problem.  There is a school of"
" thought in user interface design that asserts that a program should be "
"simple, offering the user a small number of carefully considered "
"configurable options, all of which have sensible defaults. That sort of "
"thing is usually considered :quoted:`user friendly`, while a dizzying "
"array of configrable options is considered to be hostile to the user."

"I don't disagree with that.  However, I am not so lucky as to have teams "
"dedicated to user interface design and product testing.  I don't have the"
" luxury of testing design decisions to determine if they are successful."

"Unfortunately, there are a lot of aspects of the software that need "
"sensible default values. In general, I have a good idea what a sensible "
"value might be, but I am rarely certain. My solution for any option or "
"parameter whose sensible default is open to interpretation is to make it "
"configurable.  As a result, there are 100s of aspects of "
":demeter:`demeter` that can be configured, ranging from default parameter"
" values to the colors of things that get plotted."

":demeter:`artemis` presents all of :demeter:`demeter`'s configuration "
"options in the Preferences window, which can be displayed from the File "
"Menu.  Shown here, the :guilabel:`artemis` group has been opened and the "
":configparam:`Artemis,plot_after_fit` option has been selected. Since it "
"takes one of predefined list of possible values, you are presented with "
"an option menu for selecting among the possibilities. The default value "
"can be restored by pressing the button labeled as :demeter:`demeter`'s "
"default. In the text area, the option is described. Once you change an "
"option, you can apply it to the current session or apply it and save its "
"value to :demeter:`demeter`'s initialization file."

"Different configuration options take different kinds of values. For "
"example, some are filenames, strings, real numbers, integers, colors, and"
" so on. Controls appropriate to the value type will be provided when the "
"option is clicked on."
