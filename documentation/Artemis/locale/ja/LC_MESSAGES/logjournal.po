"All of the details of the fit are recorded in the text displayed in this "
"window. Below the descriptive fitting properties displayed at the top in "
"blue text are the main fitting statistics, including |chi|\\ :sup:`2`, "
"|chi|\\ :sup:`2`\\ :sub:`v`, the R-factor, |epsilon| (k), |epsilon| (R), "
"and counts of the number of independent points and the number of "
":guess:`guess` parameters. Those are followed by the details of `the "
"happiness evaluation <fit/happiness.html>`__. Two lines of the fitting "
"statistics are colored with the same color determined from the happiness "

":demeter:`larch` does do error propagation, so eventually that will get "
"implemented in :demeter:`artemis`."
