"Let me just say up front that :demeter:`artemis` is intended as a front-"
"end to :demeter:`feff` for the problem of EXAFS analysis.  In almost all "
"cases, :demeter:`feff` is the right tool for that job and there are few "
"cases where the use of empirical standards is preferable to using "
":demeter:`feff`.  As discussed elsewhere in this manual, there are a "
"situations where the application of :demeter:`feff` to a particular "
"problem may not be obvious.  Any situation for which the choice of a "
"starting configuration of atomic coordinates, as needed for "
":demeter:`feff`'s input data, is not obvious might fall into that "
"category.  In one of those situations, you might be tempted to puruse "
"empirical standards.  You would, however, usually be better served by "
"adopting one of the strategies that have been developed for applying "
":demeter:`feff` calculations to unknown structures."

"That said, there are a small handful of situations where the use of "
"empirical standards is justified. In fact, I can think of two. The "
"situation where an absorber and a scatterer are bound by a hydrogen atom "
"|nd| i.e. there is a hydrogen atom in the space between the absorber and "
"scatterer from which the photoelectron might scatter |nd| is poorly "
"handled by :demeter:`feff`. In that case, finding a suitable empirical "
"standard will likely be an improvement over the systematic error "
"introduced by :demeter:`feff`'s poor handlng of the hydrogen. The second "
"example would be a heterogeneous sample |nd| like a soil |nd| which "
"contains a component which varies little from sample to sample. In that "
"case, using an emirical standard to represent the unchanging component "
"and using :demeter:`feff` to model the behavior of the component(s) which"
" do change across the ensemble of measurements might be a fruitful "
"strategy."

"To this end, :demeter:`demeter` offers a mechanism for generating an "
"empirical standard from measured data. This is saved in a form that can "
"be used by :demeter:`artemis` as if it were a normal path imported into "
"the fit in the normal way."

"My example will use the copper foil data at 10 K and 150 K, which can be "
"found at `at my Github site <https://github.com/bruceravel/XAS-"
"Education/tree/master/Examples>`__. In order to demonstrate the gneration"
" and use of an empirical standard, I will use the uncomplicated example "
"of using the low temperature data as the standard for the analysis of the"
" higher temperature data. Of course, a real-world scenario will be much "
"more complicated that this example, but it should demonstrate the "
"mechanics of making and using the empirical standard."

"It starts by processing the data properly. First, import the two data "
"sets into :demeter:`athena`. Take care that the data are aligned and have"
" the same values for E\\ :sub:`0`. Choose a k-range over which both data "
"sets are of good quality. I have chosen a range of 3 |AA|\\ :sup:`-1` to "
"12 |AA|\\ :sup:`-1`. Then choose an R-range to enclose and isolate the "
"first peak, which corresponds to the first coordination shell. Here, I "
"chose 1.8 |AA| to 2.8 |AA|."

"The value for |Delta| R fitted in q space is 0.001 |pm| 1. Fitted in R "
"space, the uncertainty is 0.002. That's kind of interesting. In either "
"case, the uncertainty in R is smaller than for a :demeter:`feff`-based "
"fit for a number of reasons. Probably the most significant is that both "
"standard and data are of excellent quality. Were the data the sort of "
"marginal data that comes from most research problems on difficult "
"materials, the effects of statistical and systematic noise would be much "
"more dramatic. Also relevant to the small uncertainty is that this "
"fitting problem has been contrived (by virtue of careful alignment and "
"choice of E\\ :sub:`0` back in :demeter:`athena`) to remove the fitted "
"change in E\\ :sub:`0` from the problem. By removing the parameter most "
"correlated with |Delta| R, we significantly reduces the uncertainty in "

"I would not interpret all of this to mean that use of empirical standards"

"the first coordination shell is of known contents and can be well "
"isolated from higher shells and where you are confident that your unknown"
" is identical to your standard except for small changes in N, R, or "
"|sigma|\\ :sup:`2`, then empirical standards are a useful tool for your "
"EXAFS toolbox."
