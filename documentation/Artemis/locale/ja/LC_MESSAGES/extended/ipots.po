"This is reasonable input for :demeter:`feff`. Indeed, for many crystals, "
"the elements style is exactly what you want. With four elements in the "
"cyrstal, five unique potentials are made. The absorber is always "
"potential index 0. The remaining uranium atoms are given potential index "
"1."

"For this material, it is probably a poor idea to give the axial (double "
"bonded, distance 1.76 |AA|) and equatorial (single bonded, distance 2.46 "
"|AA|) the same potential index. Doing so forces their muffin tin radii to"
" be the same. Given this substantial difference in distance, it is "
"probably a good idea to let the two types of oxygen atoms have different "
"muffin tin radii so that their scattering amplitudes and phase shifts can"
" be computed differently. That introduces a more chemically reasonable "
"potential model."

"this, we get the following :file:`feff.inp` file:"

"This is a somewhat dangerous option because :demeter:`feff` only allows "
"up to 7 potentials beyond the absorber (for a total of 8). In this "
