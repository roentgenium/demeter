":demeter:`artemis` offers several ways to get information from "
":demeter:`feff` into a fitting model.  One of these is called a *quick "
"first shell* path.  It's purpose is to provide a structureless way of "
"computing the scattering amplitude and phase shift well enough to be used"
" for a quick analysis of the first coordination shell."

"The way it works is quite simple. Given the species of the absorber and "
"the scatterer, the absorption edge (usually K or L\\ :sub:`III`), and a "
"nominal distance between the absorber and the scatterer, "
":demeter:`artemis` constructs input for :demeter:`feff`. This input data "
"assumes that the absorber and scatterer are present in a `rock salt "
"structured <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_crystal_system#Rock-"
"salt_structure>`__ crystal. The lattice constant of this notional cubic "
"crystal is such that the nearest neighbor distance is the nominal "
"distance supplied by the user. :demeter:`feff` is run and the scattering "
"path for the nearest neighbor is retained. The rest of the "
":demeter:`feff` calculation is discarded. The nearest neighbor path is "
"imported into :demeter:`artemis` with the degeneracy set to 1."

":demeter:`feff` starts by calculating neutral atoms then placing these "

" Each neutral atom has an associated radius |nd| the radius within which "
"the :quoted:`cloud` of electrons has the same charge as the nucleus of "
"the atom. The neutral-atom radii are fairly large. When placed at the "
"positions in the :demeter:`feff` input data, these neutral-atom radii "
"overlap significantly. This is a problem for :demeter:`feff`'s "
"calculation of the atomic potentials in the material because it means "
"that electrons in the overlapping regions cannot be positively identified"
" as belonging to a particular atom."

"To address this situation, :demeter:`feff` uses an algorithm called the "
"Mattheis prescription, which inscribes spheres in `Wigner-Seitz cells "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner%E2%80%93Seitz_cell>`__, to reduce "
"the radii of all atoms in the material together until the reduced radii "
"are just touching and never overlapping. These smaller radii are called "
"the muffin-tin radii. The electron density within one muffin-tin radius "
"is associated with the atom at the center of that sphere. All of the "
"electron density that falls outside of the muffin-tin spheres is "
"volumetrically averaged and treated as interstitial electron density. All"

"The reason that the two calculations shown above are so similar is "
"because the muffin-tin radii of the Fe and S atoms are almost identical. "
"This should not be surprising. Either way of constructing the muffin tins"
" |nd| using the proper FeS\\ :sub:`2` structure or using the rock-salt "
"structure |nd| start with Fe and S atoms separated by the same amount. "
"The application of the algorithm for producing muffin-tin sizes ends up "
"with nearly identical values. As a result the scattering amplitudes and "
"phase shifts are nearly the same and the resulting |chi| (k) functions "

":demeter:`artemis` offers another tool called `an SSPath "

"constructed muffin tins to compute a scattering path that is not "
"represented in the input structure provided for the :demeter:`feff` "
"calculation. For example, suppose you run a :demeter:`feff` calculation "
"on LaCoO\\ :sub:`3`, a trigonal perovskite-like material with 6 oxygen "
"scatterers at 1.93 |AA|, 8 La scatterers at 3.28 |AA| or 3.34 |AA|, and 6"

"using the muffin-tin potentials from the LaCoO\\ :sub:`3` calculation, "
"but with a Co scatterer at that distance, which is not represented in the"
" LaCoO\\ :sub:`3` structure. Unlike an attempt to use a QFS Co path at "
"that distance, the SSPath uses a scattering potential with a properly "
"calculated muffin tin. The advantage of the SSPath is that it it results "
