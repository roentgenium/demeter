"The concept of a bond in inorganic or crystal chemistry is a bit "
"ambiguous. In two seminal pair of papers, Brown and Altermatt proposed "
"this definition :quoted:`All neighboring cation-anion distances are "
"considered to be bonds although not all of equal strength.` In this "
"model, each bond between atoms i and j has a number |nd| the bond valence"
" |nd| s\\ :sub:`ij` which is inversely proportional to bond distance. The"
" bond valence is defined as s\\ :sub:`ij`\\ = exp((R\\ :sub:`0,ij` - R\\ "
":sub:`ij`)/B), where R\\ :sub:`ij` is the contact distance and R\\ "
":sub:`0,ij` and B are empirically determined parameters."

"They searched through the Inorganic Crystal Structures Database to "
"determine empirical values for s\\ :sub:`ij` for over 150 cation/anion "
"pairs. Other authors have supplemented this work with additional "
"anion/cation pairs. Most of these are for common cations, such as oxygen,"
" nitrogen, or sulfur. Interestingly, B is nearly constant across all "
"bonds and equal to 0.37. For some anions such as K and U, the value of B "
"can be as high as about 0.6. R\\ :sub:`0,ij` depends on the contact pair "
"and has been tabulated along with B in a database."

"The bond valance sum, then, is the sum of s\\ :sub:`ij` over all pairs in"
" a coordination shell: V= |Sigma| s\\ :sub:`ij`. The bond valence sum V "
"should be equal to the formal valence of the absorber cation. This "
"provides a way of relating coordination number, bond distance, and formal"
" valence in a way that is useful and directly applicable to EXAFS "
"analysis."

"Some care is taken to verify that your selection of paths is sensible. "

":demeter:`artemis` also tries to make good guesses about the formal "

"In order to make the bond valence summation, the degeneracy of each path "
"included in the sum must be multiplied by its evaluation of s\\ :sub:`ij`"
" (which also uses the evaluation of R=R\\ :sub:`0`\\ + |Delta| R as the "
"value of R\\ :sub:`ij`). Because path degeneracy might need to consider "
"quite complicated parameterization of the S\\ :sub:`0`\\ :sup:`2` path "
"parameter as well as the N path parameter, :demeter:`artemis` will "
"multiply the evaluations of the N and S\\ :sub:`0`\\ :sup:`2` path "
"parameters together to use as the evaluation of degeneracy in the "

msgid ""
"The bond valence sum can be used a :restrain:`restraint` on a fit. That "
"is, the relationship between formal valence, coordination number, and "
"bond distance can be used as prior knowledge guiding the fit. If the "
"absorber/scatterer pair are in the bond valence database, values for R\\ "
":sub:`0,ij`, B, and the formal valence of the obsorber can be defined as "
"set parameters. The bond valence sum is expressed as a def parameter.  "
"Finally, the difference between the bond valence sum and the formal "
"valence are expressed as a :restrain:`restrain` parameter. These are "
"shown below for the Fe-O bond in FeO. In FeO the iron atom is of valence "
"2+ and the oxygen is 2-."

"When the fit is evaluated, the :restrain:`restrain` parameter will be "
"added in quadrature to the evaluation of |chi|\\ :sup:`2`. This sum will "
"be minimized in the fit. In a fit to FeO, the coordination number is "
"fixed to 6, the value known from crystallography. By using this "
":restrain:`restraint`, the value of |Delta| R will be encouraged to "
"assume a value that results in a bond valence sum of 2. By increasing the"
" value of the scale parameter, the strength of the :restrain:`restraint` "
"is increased. For a very large value of scale, |Delta| R will constrained"
" to a value that forces the bond valence sum to 2. For a very small value"
" of scale, the :restrain:`restraint` will be weak and |Delta| R will be "
"given more freedom to deviate from a value that casues a bond valence sum"
