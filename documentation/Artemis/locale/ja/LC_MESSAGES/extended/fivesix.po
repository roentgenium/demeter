"Normally, the `pathfinder <../feff/paths.html>`__ in :demeter:`artemis`'s"
" implementation of :demeter:`feff` only considers up to triple scattering"
" (4-legged) paths. This is for two reasons. First, :demeter:`artemis`'s "
"pathfinder is a bit slow. Second, it is rather uncommon to need higher "
"order paths in an EXAFS analysis. Here are a few examples."

"Paradibromobenzene is a benzene molecule |nd| a ring of 6 carbon atoms "

"That big peak resulting from the second bromine atom includes not just "
"the single scattering contribution, but a number of collinear multiple "
"scattering paths. This includes the 5-legged paths that scatter from both"
" carbon atoms on the way to (or from) the bromine atoms, and the 6-legged"
" path that includes forward scattering from both carbon atoms in both "
"directions."

"5- and 6-legged paths are, in general, only important in EXAFS for "
"structures that are both rigid and have 4 collinear atoms. This is pretty"
" high bar, which is why examples are few and far between. That said, here"
" are a couple more examples."

"Prussian blue, ferric ferrocyanate, represents a class of framework-"
"structured materials that have metal atoms at corner positions in the "
"unit cell. These metal atoms are bridged by cyanide molecules. This is "
"much like a rocksalt structure, but with the cation replaced by a cyanide"
" molecule oriented in the direction of the bond."

"The metal anions are separated by about 5.1 |AA|, thus are at a distance "
"that can easily be resolved and analyzed with good EXAFS data. To "
"interpret that part of the EXAFS signal, however, it is necessary to "
"consider all the multiple scattering paths involving the C, N, and Fe "
"atoms. This includes significant, collinear 5- and 6-legged paths."

"The final example is good ol' copper metal, which is often analyzed out "
"to about 5 |AA|, a distance which includes 5 coordination shells and a "
"number of double and triple scattering paths. To analyze farther in R, "
"one eventual gets to the single scattering path which includes the face "
"center atom in the diagonally adjacent cell. In the figure below, the "
"absorber is represented by the pink atom. The distant neighbor is the "
"farthest lavender-colored atom. To analyze the single scattering "
"contribution from that distance would require consideration of all the "
"multiple scattering among the pink and lavender atoms, which are "
"collinear along that unit cell diagonal."

"Enabling the calculation of 5- and 6-legged paths significantly slows "
"down the pathfinder calculation in :demeter:`artemis`. If you are unsure "

"want to do so!"

"The default behavior in :demeter:`artemis` is to compute up to 4-legged "
"paths. For any :demeter:`feff` calculation, this can be extended to "
"include 5- and 6-legged paths by selecting the :guilabel:`6` button, as "
"indicated in the screenshot below.  Note that this sets the order of "
"scattering paths only for the current :demeter:`feff` calculation. The "
"default for all subsequent :demeter:`feff` calculations will again be "
"4-legged paths. The `aggregate calculation <../feff/aggregate.html>`__ is"
" always made with up to 4-legged paths."

"Besides being slow, the other consequence of setting the upper order of "
"multiple scattering to 6 is that the `path list <../feff/paths.html>`__ "
"will be much longer and possibly more confusing. Really, truly! Don't use"
" this feature of :demeter:`artemis` unless you have a very good reason to"

msgstr ""

#: ../../extended/fivesix.rst:196
msgid ""
":configparam:`Pathfinder,suppress_5_6_not_straight`: When true, only "
"consider 5- and 6-legged paths that have scattering angles within "
":configparam:`Pathfinder,fs_angle` (typically 20 degrees) of 0 or 180 "
"degrees.  That is, suppress all paths with angles far from forward and "
"backward scattering."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":configparam:`Atoms,suppress_nleg_warning`: When true, this will suppress"
" the dialog box posted by :demeter:`atoms` when you select the "
":guilabel:`6` button warning you against considering 5- and 6-legged "
"paths."
msgstr ""

#: ../../extended/fivesix.rst:207
msgid ""
":configparam:`Pathfinder,eta_suppress`: If you need to consider nearly "
"collinear paths in a structure with buckling of atomic planes, you may "
"need to set this parameter to false. When true, it suppresses any path "
"with a non-zero Eulerian |eta| angle. In most cases, this is a good "
"heuristic for removing irrelevant paths from the path list, however for "
"orders of scattering above 4 and nearly collinear paths, this filter "
"might remove desirable paths. Use this with caution as it will greatly "
"expand the size of the path list."
