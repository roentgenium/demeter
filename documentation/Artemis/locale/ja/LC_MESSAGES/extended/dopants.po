":demeter:`atoms` is, except in extremely contrived situations, not "

"In the :file:`feff.inp` file, there is a big list of atomic coordinates. "
"The reason that people like using :demeter:`atoms` is because, without "
":demeter:`atoms`, it is a pain in the ass to generate that list. The "
"virtue of :demeter:`atoms` is that it automates that annoying task for a "
"certain class of matter, i.e.  crystals."

":demeter:`feff` expects a point in space to be either unoccupied or "

"Let's use a very simple example |nd| gold doped into FCC copper. In FCC "
"copper, there are 12 atoms in the first shell. If the level of doping "
"was, say, 25 percent , then :demeter:`atoms` could reasonably select 3 of"
" the 12 nearest neighbors at random and replace them with gold atoms. "
"However, what should :demeter:`atoms` do with the second shell, which "
"contains 6 atoms? 25 percent of 6 is 1.5. :demeter:`feff` does not allow "
"a site to be half occupied by an atomic species, thus :demeter:`atoms` "
"would have to decide either to over-dope or under-dope the second shell."

msgid ""
"The first question is the easy one. At the programming level in "
":demeter:`demeter`, :demeter:`atoms` can do other things besides "
"generating :file:`feff.inp` files.  Calculations involving tables of "
"absorption coefficients, simulations of powder diffraction, and "
"simulations of DAFS spectra could all effectively use of the dopant "
"information. In :demeter:`artemis` you will notice that there is not even"
" a column for specifying occupancy -- in :demeter:`artemis` occupancy can"
" only be 1."

#: ../../extended/dopants.rst:106

"The second question is the tricky one and the answer is somewhat "
"different for EXAFS as for XANES. The bottom line is that you need to be "

"The best approach to simulating a XANES spectrum on a doped material that"
" I am aware of also involves running :demeter:`feff` many times. One "
"problem a colleague of mine asked me about some time ago was the "
"situation of oxygen vacancies in Au\\ :sub:`2`\\ O\\ :sub:`3`. After some"
" discussion, the solution we came up with was to use :demeter:`atoms` to "
"generate the :file:`feff.inp` for the pure material.  This fellow then "
"wrote a little computer program that would read in the :file:`feff.inp` "
"file, randomly remove oxygen atoms from the list, write the "
":file:`feff.inp` file back out with the missing oxygens, and run "
":demeter:`feff`. He would do this repeatedly, each time replacing a "
"different set of randomly selected atoms and each time saving the result."
" This set of computed spectra was then averaged. New calculations were "
"made and added to the running average until the result stopped changing. "
"If I remember, it took about 10 calculations to converge."

"Which method you use is largely a matter of taste. The first method is "
"easier to screw up, since there's a lot of counting involved. On the "
"other hand, it generates many fewer paths, and thus makes for smaller "
"files and may fit faster (you're not wasting time and effort counting "
"sulfur paths twice, for example). The first method also gives you the "
"potential of finding a few multiple scattering paths that involve both "
"iron and molybdenum (in this example) that you can't probe at all by the "
"second method. This is most likely to be true when the dopant is in low "
"concentrations but is high-Z ... it's possible that there may be a "
"molybdenum-iron multiple-scattering path that is significant, and it's "
"not going to be modeled so well by the weighted average of iron-iron and "
"molybdenum-molybdenum paths used in method 2. But the price for this is "
"that properly incorporating multiple-scattering paths via method 1 "
"requires an annoying amount of counting and thinking."
