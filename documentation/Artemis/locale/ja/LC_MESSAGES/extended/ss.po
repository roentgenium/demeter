"The |sigma|\\ :sup:`2` term in the EXAFS equation accounts for the mean "
"square variation in path length. This variation can be due to thermal or "
"structural disorder. Even in a well-ordered material, like Cu or another "
"FCC metal, data are measured at finite temperature. The absorber and "
"scatterer are both in motion due to the finite temperature. Each "
"interaction of the incident X-ray and the absorber is like a femtosecond "
"snapshot of the coordination environment. As those snapshots are averaged"
" in the EXAFS measurement, |sigma|\\ :sup:`2` is non-zero, even in the "
"well-ordered material."

"A structural disordered contributes another term to |sigma|\\ :sup:`2`. "
"Due to structural disorder, the scatterers which are nominally contained "

"It is usually a challenge to distinguish the thermal and structural "

"One common approach for understanding the thermal part of |sigma|\\ "
":sup:`2` is to measure the sample at two or more temperatures. Assuming "
"the material does not change phase in that temperature range, we expect "
"the thermal part of |sigma|\\ :sup:`2` to have a temperature dependence "
"while the structural part may reman fixed (or at least change much less)."
" Another possible way to disentangle the two contributions is to measure "
"EXAFS data as a function of pressure. In that case the thermal "
"contribution can be modeled as a function of pressure and a Gr√ºneisen "
"parameter."

msgid "Do nothing, leave the MS path out of the fit."

"Include the MS path, but allow it to have it's own |sigma|\\ :sup:`2` "

"Include the MS path, but approximate it's |sigma|\\ :sup:`2` in terms of "

"parameters of the SS |sigma|\\ :sup:`2` values."

msgid ""
"The Abs-Fe-S-Abs path in FeS\\ :sub:`2` was really quite large. Going for"
" choice number 1 and leaving it out of the fit is clearly a poor choice."
msgstr ""

#: ../../extended/ss.rst:248
msgid ""
"Number 2 is, in principle, the best choice. As an independently floated "
"parameter, it's |sigma|\\ :sup:`2` will account for the mean square "
"vriation in path length **and** the effect of variation in the scattering"
" angle.  Unfortunately, this parameter is likely not to be highly robust "
"because it is only used for this one path. There just is not much "
"information available to determine its proper value. And if the fit "
"includes several triangle paths, each of which has a |sigma|\\ :sup:`2` "
"parameter of similarly weak robustness, the problem becomes amplified."
msgstr ""

#: ../../extended/ss.rst:258
msgid ""
"In almost all cases, option number 3 is the best choice. The "
"approximation is not horribly wrong, thus it introduces only a little bit"
" of systematic error into the fitting model. Including the Fourier "
"components from the path is better than neglecting the path. Since a "
"reasonable approximation can be made without introducing new variable "
"parameters to the fit, the triangle path should be included."

"The Abs-Fe-S-Abs path had the virtue that all of its legs were "
"represented by SS paths already included in the fit. Another triangle "
"path was included: Abs-S-S-Abs. In this case, the first and last legs are"
" related to the first coordination shell. The middle leg, S-S, has no "
"corresponding SS path. In `the FeS2 example <../examples/fes2.html>`__, "
"this triangle path was given a |sigma|\\ :sup:`2` math expression of 1.5 "
"times the first shell |sigma|\\ :sup:`2`."

"This is obviously not accurate. Like all such triangle paths, the "
"decision outlined above must be worked through. In this case, the fit "
"benefits by including this triangle path, but it does not merit having "
"its own floating parameter. I assert that value of |sigma|\\ :sup:`2` "
"that is :quoted:`a bit more than the first shell` is reasonable."
