"This chapter provides an overview of crystallography tools as implemented"
" in :demeter:`artemis`. Crystallographic data is provided either in the "
"form of a CIF file or in a simpler format that has long been the input "
"format for my :demeter:`atoms` program."

"Compared to other crystallography codes, the crystallography capabilities"
" in :demeter:`artemis` are, perhaps, a little crude and incomplete. The "
"goal is to provide enough functionality to support the needs of the X-ray"
" absorption spectroscopist."
