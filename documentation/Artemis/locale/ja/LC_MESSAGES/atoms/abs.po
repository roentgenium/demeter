"Included in :demeter:`atoms` is absorption data for the elements from "
"various sources. Using this and the crystallographic information from "
":file:`atoms.inp`, :demeter:`atoms` is able to make several calculations "
"useful for XAFS analysis. It approximates the absorption depth and edge "
"step size of the material at the edge energy of the core atom and "
"estimates three corrections needed for the analysis of XAFS data. These "
"corrections are the :quoted:`McMaster correction`, the energy response of"
" the I\\ :sub:`0` chamber in a fluorescence experiment, and the self-"
"absorption of a thick material in a fluorescence experiment. All of these"
" numbers are written at the top of the output file. For more information "
"on these calculations see"

"Proper sample preparation for an XAFS experiment requires knowledge of "
"the absorption depth and edge step size of the material of interest. The "
"statistics of data collection can be optimized by choosing the correct "
"sample thickness. It is also necessary to avoid distortions to the data "
"due to thickness and large particle size effects."

":demeter:`atoms` calculates the total cross section of the material above"
" the edge energy of the central atom and divides by the unit cell volume."
" The number obtained, |mu|\\ :sub:`total`, has units of cm\\ :sup:`-1`. "
"Thus, if ``x`` is the thickness of the sample in cm, the x-ray beam "
"passing through the sample will be attenuated by exp(|mu|\\ :sub:`total` "
"\\* ``x``)."

":demeter:`atoms` also calculates the change in cross section of the "
"central atom below and above the absorption edge and divides by the unit "
"cell volume.  This number, |Delta|\\ |mu|, multiplied by the sample "
"thickness in cm gives the approximate edge step in a transmission "
"experiment."

"Typically, XAFS data is normalized to a single number representing the "
"size of the edge step. While there are compelling reasons to use this "
"simple normalization, it can introduce an important distortion to the "
"amplitude of the |chi| (k) extracted from the absorption data. This "
"distortion comes from energy response of the bare atom absorption of the "
"central atom. This is poorly approximated away from the edge by a single "
"number. Because this affects the amplitude of |chi| (k) and not the "
"phase, it can be corrected by including a Debye-Waller factor and a "
"fourth cumulant in the analysis of the data. These two :quoted:`McMaster "
"corrections` are intended to be additive corrections to any thermal or "
"structural disorder included in the analysis of the XAFS."

":demeter:`atoms` uses data from Elam to construct the bare atom "
"absorption for the central atom. :demeter:`atoms` then regresses a "
"quadratic polynomial in energy to the natural logarithm of the "
"constructed central atom absorption.  Because energy and photo-electron "
"wave number are simply related, E is proportional to k\\ :sup:`2`, the "
"coefficients of this regression can be related to the XAFS Debye-Waller "
"factor and fourth cumulant. The coefficient of the term linear in energy "
"equals ``sigma_MM^2`` and the coefficient of the quadratic term equals "
"``4/3 * sigma_MM^4``. The values of ``sigma_MM^2`` and ``sigma_MM^4`` are"
" written at the top of the output file."

"The response of the I\\ :sub:`0` chamber varies with energy during an "
"XAFS experiment. In a fluorescence experiment, the absorption signal is "
"obtained by normalizing the I\\ :sub:`f` signal by the I\\ :sub:`0` "
"signal. There is no energy response in the I\\ :sub:`f` signal since all "
"atoms fluoresce at set energies. The energy response of I\\ :sub:`0` is "
"ignored by this normalization. At low energies this can be a significant "
"effect. Like the McMaster correction, this effect attenuates the "
"amplitude of |chi| (k) and is is well approximated by an additional "
"Debye-Waller factor and fourth cumulant."

":demeter:`atoms` uses the values of the ``nitrogen``, ``argon`` and "
"``krypton`` keywords in :file:`atoms.inp` to determine the content of the"
" I\\ :sub:`0` chamber by pressure.  It assumes that the remainder of the "
"chamber is filled with helium.  It then uses McMaster's data to construct"
" the energy response of the chamber and regresses a polynomial to it in "

"If the thickness of a sample is large compared to absorption length of "
"the sample and the absorbing atom is sufficiently concentrated in the "
"sample, then the amplitude of the |chi| (k) extracted from the data taken"
" on it in fluorescence will be distorted by self-absorption effects in a "
"way that is easily estimated. The absorption depth of the material might "
"vary significantly through the absorption edge and the XAFS wiggles. The "
"correction for this effect is well approximated as"

"where |mu|\\ :sub:`background` is the absorption of the non-resonant "
"atoms in the material and |mu|\\ :sub:`fluo` is the total absorption of "
"the material at the fluorescent energy of the absorbing atom. "
":demeter:`atoms` constructs this function using the McMaster tables then "
"regresses a polynomial to it in the manner described above. "
"``sigma_self^2`` and ``sigma_self^4`` are written at the top of the "
"output file and intended as additive corrections in the analysis. Because"
" the size of the edge step is affected by self-absorption, the amplitude "
"of |chi| (k) is attenuated when normalized to the edge step. Since the "
"amplitude is a measure of S\\ :sup:`2`\\ :sub:`0`, this is an important "
"effect. The number reported in :file:`feff.inp` as the amplitude factor "
"is intended to be a multiplicative correction to the data or to the "
"measured S\\ :sup:`2`\\ :sub:`0`."
