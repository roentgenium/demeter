"Here is an example of :demeter:`atoms` in action. The material is lead "
"titanate, PbTiO\\ :sub:`3`. The crystallographic literature places this "
"material in the tetragonal space group ``P 4 M M``. Let's suppose tha the"
" data were taken in fluorescence at the titanium K-edge. Since the edge "
"energy is around 5 KeV and the sample was very thick, the I\\ :sub:`0` "
"and self-absorption corrections are expected to be significant. That "
"titanium is the central atom is indicated by the keyword ``core``. "
":demeter:`atoms` assumes the K-edge of the titanium was probed because "
"the atomic number of titanium is less than 57 and the edge was not "
"otherwise chosen with the ``edge`` keyword.  The I\\ :sub:`0` chamber was"
" filled with 50% helium and 50% nitrogen by pressure.  This is indicated "
"by the ``nitrogen`` keyword. The size of the cluster to be printed in "
":file:`feff.inp` is chosen with the ``rmax`` keyword. The ``rpath`` "
"keyword is used to set the value of ``RMAX`` in the :file:`feff.inp` "
"file, which indicates the length of the longest path to be calculated."

"Note that CIF files can also be used as the input to :demeter:`atoms` and"
" will, in many cases, work just fine. The code that reads the CIF files "
"is rather incomplete and a bit buggy, though. Also, :demeter:`demeter` "
"will refuse to attempt to import data from a CIF file that contains "
"multiple occupancy for a crystallographic site."

":demeter:`atoms` produces the output reproduced below. The absorption and"
" correction calculations are at the top of the file. All the ``CONTROL`` "
"cards are set to 1 and the ``PRINT`` cards are set to 0. This will run "
"all four modules of :demeter:`feff` and produce the default output files."
" Several other useful :demeter:`feff` cards are printed but commented out"
" by an asterisk (``*``). The unique potential list is constructed in a "
"simple fashion -- the core atom is potential 0 and each different atomic "
"species has a single potential. The atom list is printed in the format "
"required by :demeter:`feff`. The atom list has two comment columns. The "
"indexed atomic symbol and radial distance are written by :demeter:`atoms`"
" for your use when reading :file:`feff.inp` and are ignored by "
":demeter:`feff`."

":demeter:`feff` will run to completion using the input file generated by "
":demeter:`atoms`. It is still likely that the user will want to edit "
":file:`feff.inp`. Several assumptions are made by :demeter:`atoms` that "
"might not hold true. The assignment of unique potentials is made by a "
"simple algorithm and may not adequately reflect the physics of the "
"problem. The ``CONTROL`` cards are such that all four modules of "
":demeter:`feff` will be run. The :demeter:`feff` user might want to run "
"the modules separately. Values for other cards have been assumed and "
"might not be desired. Other cards have been left out entirely. Always "
"check your :file:`feff.inp` file to be sure it is just what you want."
