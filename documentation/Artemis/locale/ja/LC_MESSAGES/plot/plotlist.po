"The most basic way of moving a data set or a path to the plotting list is"
" to click on a plot transfer button. These are the light blue buttons "
"|nd| |transfer button| |nd| at the top of the Data window. There is one "
"to the left of the name of the data set. Clicking on this button inserts "
"that data at the end of the plotting list. There is also a transfer "
"button on each Path page to the left of the path's name."

"In this way, the plotting list can be built up item by item. The order in"
" which items are inserted into the plotting list is the order in which "
"they are displayed in the plot. An item can be removed from a plot "
"without removing it from the plotting list by unchecking its check box."

"Of course, adding a number of paths to the plotting list by checking on "
"their individual transfer buttons can be quite tedious. Transfering of "
"items into the plotting list is another of the many chores that use the "
"set of marked paths. Marking a path is done is by checking its check box "
"in the Path list or by using one of the handy options in `the Marks menu "
"<../data.html#themarksmenu>`__. Once a set of paths is marked, selecting "
":menuselection:`Actions --> Transfer marked` will move that set in order "
"to the end of the plotting list. By learning to use path marks "
"effectively, you can quickly build interesting plots which include data "
"along with many paths. Note that keyboard shortcuts exist for everything "
"in the Mark and Actions menus. These are shown in the menus themselves. "
"Learning these shortcuts makes setting up interesting plots much faster "
"and easier."

"the paths included in the fitting model for the data. The VPath will be "
"placed in the plotting list in the `Plot window <plot/index.html>`__ and "
"the plot will be made in R. You can then plot in other spaces using the "
