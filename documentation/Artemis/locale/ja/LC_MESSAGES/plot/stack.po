"The :guilabel:`stack` tab holds controls for providing vertical offset "
"between traces in a plot. The top set of controls works very similarly to"
" the stacking feature in :demeter:`athena`. When the check button is "
"clicked on, paths will be offset vertically as indicated by the the two "
"values. The initial value is the offset applied to the data. All parts of"
" the data (fit, window, etc) will also be plotrted with that offset. The "
"second value is a vertical displacement between successive paths. Note "
"that the displacement is downward |nd| that is, a value of +2 means to "
"displace each path by -2 on the y-axis. In this way, traces appear in the"
" same top-to-bottom order as the plot legend when a positive value is "
"chosen."

"The second group of controls is used to multiply paths by -1 before "
"plotting. This results in the data pointing up and the individual paths "
"pointing down. This feature is turned off when the check button for a "
"stacked plot is clicked on."

"The last control is used to specify a vertical offset between data sets "
"when plotting more than one data set from a multiple data set fit. Note "
"that this stacking parameter and the individual data set stacking "
"parameters will each provide some vertical offset, requiring careful "
"consideration for an attractive plot."

"Here is an example of a stacked plot. Shown are Co foil data, the fit "
"function, and the fitting window. Offset downward are the paths from the "
"first two coordination shells as evaluated in the fit. Note that the size"
" of an appropriate offset depends on the k-weighting and on the space the"
" plot is made it.  :demeter:`artemis` does not attempt to compute a "
"sensible value |nd| that is up to you."

"Finally, here is an example of stacked data sets. This is a multiple data"
" set fit to dimethytin dichloride and monomethyltin trichloride. The "
"visualize both parts of this fit, it is convenient offset the "
"monomethyltin trichloride data and paths downward by enough to completely"
" separate the traces associated with each data set. Again, the value of "
"the offset depends on the k-weighting and on the sapce in which the plot "
"is made."
