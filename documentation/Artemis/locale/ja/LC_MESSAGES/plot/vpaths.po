"A common problem with visualizing the paths that contribute to a fit "
"occurs when several single and multiple scatteriung paths contribute "
"spectral wieght in the same region of R space. In a well-ordered material"
" like these data on a cobalt foil, a distant single scattering path may "
"be of the same length as two or more important collinear multiple "
"scattering paths. The fit involves a subtle superposition of all the "
"paths in the fit. This single scattering path and its related multiple "
"scattering paths all contribute spectral weight in the same region of "
"R-space."

"Plotting them together results in a complicated figure with lots of "
"overlapping traces. It is hard to see how each path contributes to the "
"fit. Indeed, it is hard to ascertain much beyond the fact that these "
"three paths have a complicated phase relationship between them."

":demeter:`artemis` offers a handy visualization tool called a virtual "
"path, or VPath. A VPath is simply a group of paths which are added "
"together after being evaluated in a fit. The sum of these paths is then "
"plotted as a single item in a fit. Here is the plot made with the VPath "
"constructed from the three paths in the previous figure. While this plot "
"hides the individual contributions of the three path, it shows how those "
"three affect the fit when added together."

"The VPath is made by marking the contributing paths, then choosing "

"Here is another example of how a VPath can help visualize the components "
"of a fit.  The data in the following figures are of uranium L\\ "
":sub:`III` edge EXAFS of uranyl acetate in solution. Uranyl compounds are"
" notable for having two, very short double-bonded oxygen atoms in a trans"
" configuration and at a distance of about 1.78 |AA|. The remaining oxygen"
" atoms lie in an equatorial plane.  These are single-bonded and at a "
"distance of around 2.4 |AA|."

"The two axial oxygen atoms usually have a rather small |sigma|\\ :sup:`2`"
" and contribute very strongly at low R in the Fourier transform. Because "
"those oxygen atoms are at such a short distance, there are a few multiple"
" scattering paths that contribute significant spectral weight just beyond"
" the region dominated by single scattering from the equatorial oxygen "
"atoms."

"Here is the plot the fit to the uranyl acetate data along with each of "
"the single and multiple scattering paths that involve the axial oxygen "
"atoms.  Again, it is hard to appreciate how the various multiple "
"scattering paths contribute to the fit."
