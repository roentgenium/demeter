"You have `already been introduced <../startup/plot.html>`__ to the basic "
"functionality of the Plot window. In this chapter, all the details of "
":demeter:`artemis`' plotting system will be explained. While "
":demeter:`artemis` does not provide all the plotting capabilities offered"
" by real plotting tools like Gnuplot, Origin, Excel, Kaleidagraph, and "
"others, it does provide enough options to create interesting and "
"instructive visualization of your EXAFS fitting project."

"Let's briefly go over the basic features of the Plot window. The buttons "
"at the top are used to make plots of data and paths in one of the three "
"spaces. The data listed in the plotting list at the bottom of the Plot "
"window will be included in the plots made with those three buttons."

"The part of the complex |chi| (R) or |chi| (q) functions is controled by "
"the two sets of radiobuttons at the top of the :guilabel:`limits` tab. "
"Additional traces |nd| the fit, the window, and so on â€“ can be included "
"by clicking on their check buttons. Finally, the plotting range along the"
" x-axis can be set for each of the three spaces. At the top of the Plot "
"window are a series of radio buttons used to set the k-weighting used in "
"plots. A plot of |chi| (k) will be weighted by the specified factor of k."
" Plots of |chi| (R) or |chi| (q) will use that valule of k-weighting for "
"the forward Fourier transform."

"The :guilabel:`kw` option for k-weighting will use the user-specified "
"value of k-weight for each data set included in the plot. That value will"
" also be used for any paths associated with that data set."

#: ../../plot/index.rst:77
msgid ""
"Please note that the value of k-weight selected for plotting has no "
"bearing on how the fit is performed. The k-weighting specified on the "
"Data window is used to evaluate the fit. Fit evaluation and visualization"
" are different tasks, each with their own value of k-weight."
