":demeter:`feff` provides a crude evaluation of the importance of each "
"path called the :quoted:`curved wave importance factor`. This is computed"
" as a very sparse |nd| computed at four points between 0 |AA|\\ :sup:`-1`"
" and 20\\ |AA|\\ :sup:`-1` |nd| trapezoidal integration of \\| |chi| "
"(k)\\|. This amplitude is then expressed as a percentage with the largest"
" path having an amplitude of 100."
msgstr ""

#: ../../feff/paths.rst:221
msgid ""
"There are a few shortcomings of :demeter:`feff`'s amplitude factor. "
"First, the percentages are computed serially. So the first path is always"
" given as 100%. If a subsequent path is larger than the first path, it, "
"so, will be given as 100%. All following paths will be scaled to size of "
"the later path. This is somewhat confusing."

#: ../../feff/paths.rst:227
msgid ""
"Second, the integration is very sparse. This made sense back in the mid-"
"90s, when computers were slower and had less memory. But it means the "
"amplitude is not very accurate."
msgstr ""

#: ../../feff/paths.rst:231
msgid ""
"Finally, the integration is over a much wider range in k-space than is "
"typically measured in a real experiment. It would make more sense to "
"evaluate a measure of the importance of a path over a range in k that is "
"expressed in a real measurement or, at least, a range that is more "
"typical of a normal experiment."

"the range in k is 3\\ |AA|\\ :sup:`-1` and 12\\ |AA|\\ :sup:`-1` and in R"
