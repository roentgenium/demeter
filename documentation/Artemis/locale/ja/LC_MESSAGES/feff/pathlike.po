"One of the powerful features in :demeter:`artemis` is the ability to "
"define :quoted:`path-like` objects. A path-like object is one which can "
"be treated like a normal path from :demeter:`feff`. It can be used in a "
"fit and it can be plotted.  It is not, however, the result of a normal "
":demeter:`feff` calculation. Instead, :demeter:`feff` has been run in "
"some special way to generate a theoretical |chi| (k) spectrum for "
"something different from all the items listed on the Paths tab."

"Controls for generating these things are divided into different pages "
"accessible by the menu at the top of the Path-like tab. The first item in"

"The concept of a :quoted:`Single Scattering Path` (or :quoted:`SSPath`) "
"is that it uses the potentials from a :demeter:`feff` calculation to "
"compute the single scattering contribution from an atom that exists in "
"that :demeter:`feff` calculation but at a distance not represented in the"
" list of cartesian coordinates."

"In the example shown, a :demeter:`feff` calculation has been run on "
"LaCoO\\ :sub:`3`, a trigonal perovskite-like material with 6 oxygen "

"Suppose we had some reason to wonder what a Co scatterer at a distance of"
" 3 |AA| would look like in a fit. (For example, we might suspect that "
"some phase segregation happened during synthesis, resulting in some CoO.)"
" In that case, the distance on the :guilabel:`SSPath` page would be set "
"to 3.0 |AA| and the Co scatterer would be selected from the group of "
"radio buttons.  This group of radio buttons corresponds to the list of "
"unique potentials in the input data for :demeter:`feff`."

"The method for associating this :guilabel:`SSPath` with data will be "
"explained in the `next chapter <../path/index.html>`__. For now, we "
"simply look at :numref:`Fig. %s <fig-feffplotss>` to compare the normal "
"Co scatterer at 3.83 |AA| (blue) with the SSPath computed at 3 |AA| "
"(red)."

"Use of :guilabel:`SSPath` for modeling scatterers at such a long distance"
" is much superior to using a `quick first shell theory "
"<../path/pathlike.html>`__. The advantage of this approach is that it "
"uses well constructed scattering potentials |nd| i.e. potentials from a "
"real structure |nd| to make the special path. Using the quick first shell"
" technique on a path this long results in poorly constructed potentials. "
"This is explained in detail in `the extended discussions chapter "
