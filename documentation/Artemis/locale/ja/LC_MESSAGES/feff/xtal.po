"The crystal cell data |nd| including lattice constants and angles, the "
"space group symbol, and the elements of the shift vector |nd| are placed "
"in text boxes for easy editing. The coordinates of the unique sites are "
"listed in the grid at the bottom of the window. The absorber is chosen by"
" clicking one of the boxes on the :guilabel:`Core` column."

"Remember that :demeter:`feff` considers numbers with 5 digits of "
"precision after the decimal point. ``0.333`` is not the same thing as "
"``0.33333``. You may, however, enter things like ``1/3`` and avoid the "
"precision issue entirely."

"As a new feature compared to earlier versions of :demeter:`atoms`, there "
"are two radial distances. The cluster size determines the extent of the "
"cluster expanded into the feff.inp. This should usually be set to "
"something rather large, 9 |AA| is often a good default.  This probably "
"(but not always!) assures that the cluster in the :file:`feff.inp` file "
"is adequately large to include all unique potentials and has all atom "
"types sufficiently well bounded that the muffin tin potentials are likely"
" to be be computed reasonably well."

"The second distance will set the value of ``RMAX`` in the "
":file:`feff.inp` file.  In general, you do not want this to be much "
"larger than the extent of the data you intend to analyze. 5 |AA| or 6 "
"|AA| is usually the largest sensible value for longest path. The reason "
"for this is that the pathfinder part of :demeter:`feff` has been "
"rewritten for this version of :demeter:`artemis`.  While the new "
"pathfinder implementation offers a number of useful new features, it is "
"substantially slower than :demeter:`feff`'s native pathfinder. In any "
"case, there is no benefit to computing paths that you will never use in "
"your fit."

"The absorption edge for the calculation is chosen from the menu to the "
"left of the lattice constant area. This is usually determined from the "
"input data, but may need to be explicitly selected. If not specified in "
"the :file:`atoms.inp` file, the edge will be set to K for element lighter"
" than Ce (Z=58), and to L\\ :sub:`III` for heavier elements."

"Remember that :demeter:`feff` only allows for 7 unique potentials other "
"than the absorber. The tags and sites options can often result in more "
"than 7 potnatials, which will result in an unrunnable :file:`feff.inp` "
"file. Specifying unique potentials by tags is a good way of "
"differentiating between dissimilar atoms of the same species. For "
"example, in an oxygenyl species, it is often useful to give the axial "
"oxygen atoms a different potential from the remaining oxygens by using "
"the tags option."

"Here is an example of an :file:`atoms.inp` file for sodium uranyl "
"acetate, which contains two very short axial oxygen atoms double bonded "
"to the uranium atoms at about 1.8 |AA| and a number of equatorial oxygen "
"atoms at a much longer distance. The axial and equatorial oxygen "
"positions are distinguished by their tags and will given separate unique "
"potentials when using the tags style."

"This vector sets the value of the ``POLARIZATION`` keyword in the "
