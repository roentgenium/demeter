"If crystal data has two or more inequivalent sites occupied by the same "
"kind of atom, some additional functionality is enabled when one of the "
"inequivalent sites is selected as the absorber. As you can see in the "
"following screenshot, the :button:`Aggregate,light` button is available, "
"as are controls for setting the `fuzzy degeneracy "
"<../extended/fuzzy.html>`__ parameters."

"In the aggregate :demeter:`feff` calculation, the path finder is run for "
"each inequivalent position containing the same central atom. The path "
"lists are merged together, weighted by fractional population of the site "
"in the unit cell, before running the check for `fuzzy degeneracy "
"<../extended/fuzzy.html>`__. The weighting by population fraction means "
"that a bin of paths can be occupied by a non-integer number of atoms."

"In the example of CaZrTi\\ :sub:`2`\\ O\\ :sub:`7`, there are three Ti "
"sites. The are 8 :guilabel:`Ti1` atoms in the unit cell and 4 each of "
":guilabel:`Ti2` and :guilabel:`Ti3`.  Thus half the Ti atoms are from "
"site 1 and a quarter each from sites 2 and 3. Each Ti site is surrounded "
"by 6 oxygen atoms at a variety of distances. :guilabel:`Ti1` has O atoms "
"at 1.843 |AA|, 1.880 |AA|, 1.927 |AA|, 1.987 |AA|, 2.0007 |AA|, and 2.023"
" |AA|. :guilabel:`Ti2` has 2 O atoms at each of 1.786 |AA|, 2.050 |AA|, "
"2.498 |AA|. :guilabel:`Ti3` has 2 O atoms at each of 1.975 |AA|, 1.877 "
"|AA|, 1.975 |AA|. In short, the Ti K edge of CaZrTi\\ :sub:`2`\\ O\\ "
":sub:`7` is a mess!"

"Using a bin size of 0.1 |AA| and combining the three sites together "
