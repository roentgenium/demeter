" thickness of the sample at this energy. Weighing out 4 milligrams of "

"The 4 milligrams of sample required for one absorption length is "

"A sample with an edge step of 1 is made by mixing 28.3 milligrams of "

"lengths of ferrite. The ferrite in BN will, therefore, attenuate the beam"
" passing through the sample to the level of exp(-3.1), or about 4.5%."

msgid ""
"In an early XAS paper by Stern and Kim, it was shown that the edge step "
"of a sample should not exceed 1.5. Using a simple statistical argument "
"that presumes that measurement uncertainty is dominated by shot noise, "
"the authors show that a sample is optimized when the total absorption is "
"2.6. In this case, the sample of ferrite in BN can be made such that both"
" total absorption and edge step are close to optimal. For instance, "
"making the sample with 2 absorption lengths (i.e. 8 milligrams or 16.4 "
"microns) of ferrite will result in an edge step of 0.68 |nd| an excellent"
" sample! Not all materials |nd| particularly those for which a minority "

"The calculation of absorption length in units of length, in this case 8.2"
" microns, is another useful metric for high quality sample preparation. "
"To mix ferrite powder with BN to obtain a nicely homogeneous sample, it "
"is necessary that the ferrite powder be composed of grains that are small"
" compared to the absorption length. In this, you would want micron-sized "
"or smaller grains. Note that a stack of laboratory metal meshes are not "
"adequate for separating out powders for this sample. A 400 mesh |nd| "
"usually the finest one in a common stack of sieves |nd| has openings of "
"37 microns. That is vastly too large for your ferrite XAS samples!"

"Transmission XAS samples are often made with 10s of milligrams of "
"material. That is true for the example given above and, indeed, for many "
"materials science problems. 10s of milligrams of sample is a very small "
"quantity. That material must be distributed in the beam uniformly and "
"packaged in a manner that can be readily handled. What's more, the sample"
" may need to survive placement in a cryostat, a furnace, or some other in"
" situ environment. In the example given above, reference is made to boron"
" nitride. BN is often used a sample matrix by mixing the sample "
"thoroughly in the BN and pressing the mixed powders into a pellet using a"
" hydrolic press. This results in a sample which is thick enough to manage"
